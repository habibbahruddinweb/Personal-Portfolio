<p>My father is a businessman and my mother is a fulltime housewife. Apart from that, my eldest brother and sister is was married and working with my father helping him handle the business. We all love and respect each other. We all celebrate every birthday with great love and pride. Everyone gets a new gift on each birthday. My mother always keep giving a nice quotes for us being independent person someday. She has taught us the self discipline, confidence and cooperation in work.</p>
<p>"Being a family means you are a part of something very wonderful. It means you will love and be loved for the rest of your life."</p>
